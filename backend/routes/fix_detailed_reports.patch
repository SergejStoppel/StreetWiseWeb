## Summary of Issues Found and Fixes

### Issues Identified:

1. **Score Calculation Bug**: `accessibilityScore` was using wrong fallback value
   - Fixed in accessibility.js line 954

2. **Cached Reports Ignore New Report Type**: When user requests "detailed" but cache has "overview", it returns the cached "overview"
   - Need to regenerate report with ReportService if report type differs

3. **Development Mode Not Working Properly**: Even with APP_ENV=development, detailed reports require subscription
   - Fixed ReportService to check both NODE_ENV and APP_ENV

4. **Missing Subscriptions Table**: Causes warning and prevents detailed report access
   - Created SQL script to add table

5. **SEO/AI Data Not Retrieved**: transformDbRecord was looking for wrong columns
   - Fixed to extract from analysis_data JSONB field

### To Complete the Fix:

1. Modify cached report handling to respect requested report type
2. Ensure development mode allows detailed reports for authenticated users
3. Run the subscriptions table creation script

### Code Changes Needed:

In `/backend/routes/accessibility.js` around line 441, change:
```javascript
// Add this after line 435:
// Check if requested report type differs from cached type
if (reportType !== cachedAnalysis.report_type && req.user) {
  logger.info('Cached report type differs from requested, regenerating report', {
    cachedType: cachedAnalysis.report_type,
    requestedType: reportType,
    analysisId: cachedAnalysis.id
  });
  
  // Use ReportService to generate the appropriate report type
  const reportService = new ReportService();
  const regeneratedReport = await reportService.generateReport(reconstructedAnalysis, {
    user: req.user,
    requestedReportType: reportType,
    language: language
  });
  
  // Update the report type
  reconstructedAnalysis.reportType = reportType;
  reconstructedAnalysis.structuredReport = regeneratedReport;
}
```

This will ensure that when a user requests a detailed report, they get a detailed report even if the cache has an overview report.
