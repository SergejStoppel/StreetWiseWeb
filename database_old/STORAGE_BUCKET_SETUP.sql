-- SUPABASE STORAGE BUCKET SETUP
-- =====================================================
-- Run this script in Supabase SQL Editor AFTER creating
-- the 'analysis-screenshots' bucket in Storage UI
-- =====================================================

-- NOTE: You must create the bucket first in Storage UI:
-- 1. Go to Storage ‚Üí Create bucket
-- 2. Name: analysis-screenshots 
-- 3. Make it PUBLIC (toggle on)
-- 4. Then run this script

-- =====================================================
-- STORAGE BUCKET POLICIES
-- =====================================================

-- Remove any existing policies for this bucket
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can upload screenshots" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view screenshots" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own screenshots" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own screenshots" ON storage.objects;

-- 1. INSERT Policy - Authenticated users can upload screenshots
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload screenshots"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'analysis-screenshots');

-- 2. SELECT Policy - Public can view screenshots (needed for sharing reports)
CREATE POLICY "Public can view screenshots"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'analysis-screenshots');

-- 3. DELETE Policy - Users can delete their own screenshots
-- This uses a folder-based approach where files are organized by user ID
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own screenshots"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'analysis-screenshots' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- 4. UPDATE Policy - Users can update their own screenshot metadata
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own screenshots"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'analysis-screenshots' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
