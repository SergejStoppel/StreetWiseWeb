### **Phase 2: The Modular Analysis Engine**

#### **Issue #2.4: Implement Accessibility Worker: ARIA & Screen Readers**

- **Problem:** We need to analyze the website's use of ARIA attributes, which are critical for screen reader users.
- **Goal/Benefit:** To identify issues that directly impact visually impaired users, handled by a dedicated, lightweight worker.
- **Acceptance Requirements:**
    - [ ] A new `workers/accessibility/aria.worker.ts` is created.
    - [ ] The worker reads the pre-fetched HTML from storage.
    - [ ] It runs `axe-core` checks tagged with "aria" (e.g., `aria-roles`, `aria-hidden-body`).
    - [ ] It creates records in the `accessibility_issues` table for each violation.
    - [ ] **Tests:** A unit test is written with mock HTML containing ARIA violations, verifying the correct issues are logged.
- **Implementation Details:**
    - This worker will run in parallel with the color contrast worker and all other analyzer workers.
