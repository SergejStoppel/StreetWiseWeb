### **Phase 2: The Modular Analysis Engine**

#### **Issue #2.7: Implement Performance Worker: Image Optimization**

- **Problem:** Large, unoptimized images are one of the biggest causes of slow page loads.
- **Goal/Benefit:** To identify specific images that can be optimized to dramatically improve page speed, handled by a dedicated, lightweight worker.
- **Acceptance Requirements:**
    - [ ] A `workers/performance/imageOptimization.worker.ts` is created.
    - [ ] The worker analyzes the pre-fetched HTML to find all `<img>` tags.
    - [ ] For each image, it checks:
        -   If the image is using a next-gen format (e.g., WebP, AVIF).
        -   If the rendered dimensions are significantly smaller than the actual image dimensions.
        -   If `width` and `height` attributes are present to prevent layout shift.
    - [ ] It creates records in the `performance_issues` table for each image that can be improved.
    - [ ] **Tests:** A unit test is written with mock HTML containing various image issues, verifying they are correctly identified.
- **Implementation Details:**
    - The fetcher worker will need to be updated to download the image files themselves so their dimensions can be analyzed. This can be a secondary, lower-priority task within the fetcher.
