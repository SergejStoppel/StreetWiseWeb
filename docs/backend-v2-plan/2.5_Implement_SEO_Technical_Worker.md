### **Phase 2: The Modular Analysis Engine**

#### **Issue #2.5: Implement SEO Worker: Technical SEO**

- **Problem:** We need to analyze technical signals that tell search engines how to crawl and index the website.
- **Goal/Benefit:** To identify critical technical issues that can prevent a site from being properly indexed, handled by a dedicated, lightweight worker.
- **Acceptance Requirements:**
    - [ ] A `workers/seo/technicalSeo.worker.ts` is created.
    - [ ] The worker reads the pre-fetched HTML and `robots.txt` from storage.
    - [ ] It performs checks for:
        -   Presence and validity of `robots.txt`.
        -   Use of `rel="canonical"` tags to prevent duplicate content.
        -   Presence of `x-robots-tag` HTTP headers.
    - [ ] It creates records in the `seo_issues` table for each finding.
    - [ ] **Tests:** A unit test is written with mock HTML and `robots.txt` content to verify that canonical and robots issues are correctly identified.
- **Implementation Details:**
    - The fetcher worker must be updated to also fetch the `robots.txt` file if it exists.
