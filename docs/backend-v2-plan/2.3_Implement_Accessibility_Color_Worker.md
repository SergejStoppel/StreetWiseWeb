### **Phase 2: The Modular Analysis Engine**

#### **Issue #2.3: Implement Accessibility Worker: Color & Contrast**

- **Problem:** We need to analyze the website for issues related to color contrast, which is a major part of accessibility.
- **Goal/Benefit:** To provide users with specific, actionable feedback on color and contrast issues, handled by a dedicated, lightweight worker.
- **Acceptance Requirements:**
    - [ ] A new `workers/accessibility/colorContrast.worker.ts` is created.
    - [ ] The worker reads the pre-fetched HTML/CSS from storage.
    - [ ] It specifically runs `axe-core` checks tagged with "color" or "contrast" (e.g., `color-contrast`).
    - [ ] For each violation, it creates a record in the `accessibility_issues` table, mapping it to the correct rule from our `rules` table.
    - [ ] **Tests:** A unit test is written, providing mock HTML/CSS and a mock Axe result, verifying that the correct records are created in the database.
- **Implementation Details:**
    - This worker will be much lighter and faster than a full accessibility scan, as it's only looking for a subset of rules.
    - It will receive the path to the stored assets as part of its job data.
