### **Phase 0: Project Setup & Environment**

#### **Issue #0.2: Dockerize the Full Development Environment**

- **Problem:** To ensure consistency between development and production, the entire application stack should run in containers. This avoids "it works on my machine" issues.
- **Goal/Benefit:** A single-command setup that launches the entire application stack (frontend, backend, database, Redis), simplifying development and testing.
- **Acceptance Requirements:**
    - [ ] A `Dockerfile` is created in `backend-v2` for the Node.js application.
    - [ ] A root-level `docker-compose.yml` is created.
    - [ ] The compose file defines services for `backend-v2`, `postgres`, `redis`, and the existing `frontend`.
    - [ ] All services start without errors when running `docker-compose up`.
    - [ ] The `start-dev.bat` and `start-docker.bat` scripts are updated to use the new `docker-compose.yml`.
    - [ ] The backend can successfully connect to the `postgres` and `redis` services within the Docker network.
- **Implementation Details:**
    - The `backend-v2` `Dockerfile` should use a multi-stage build for a smaller production image.
    - Use official images from Docker Hub for `postgres:15` and `redis:latest`.
    - Use environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` for configuration (e.g., database passwords).
    - Ensure ports are mapped correctly (e.g., backend API to `localhost:3001`, frontend to `localhost:3000`).
