### **Phase 0: Project Setup & Environment**

#### **Issue #0.1: Initialise Backend Project & Tooling**

- **Problem:** We need a clean, modern, and type-safe foundation for the new backend codebase.
- **Goal/Benefit:** To establish a consistent and high-quality development environment from day one, which will speed up development and reduce bugs.
- **Acceptance Requirements:**
    - [ ] A new directory `backend-v2` is created.
    - [ ] The project is initialised as a Node.js/TypeScript project.
    - [ ] A strict `tsconfig.json` is configured.
    - [ ] ESLint and Prettier are configured and can be run via `npm run lint` and `npm run format`.
    - [ ] The modular directory structure defined in `ARCHITECTURE.md` is created.
    - [ ] Jest (or Vitest) is installed and configured for testing. A sample test passes when running `npm test`.
- **Implementation Details:**
    - Use `npm init -y` and `npm install typescript @types/node ts-node --save-dev`.
    - Use `npx tsc --init` to generate a `tsconfig.json` and enable strict type-checking options.
    - Follow standard guides to set up ESLint for TypeScript and Prettier.
    - Create the directories as defined in the architecture plan.
    - Install Jest and `ts-jest`. Configure `jest.config.js`.
