### **Phase 2: The Modular Analysis Engine**

#### **Issue #2.9: Implement AI Summary Worker**

- **Problem:** The detailed analysis produces a lot of data. Users need a high-level, easy-to-understand summary of the most important issues.
- **Goal/Benefit:** To provide an AI-powered executive summary that helps users quickly grasp the key findings and prioritize their efforts.
- **Acceptance Requirements:**
    - [ ] A `workers/aiSummary.worker.ts` is created.
    - [ ] This worker is triggered only after all other analyzer jobs for a given `analysis_id` are `completed`.
    - [ ] The worker fetches all `*_issues` records for the completed analysis.
    - [ ] It formats this data into a concise summary and sends it to an LLM API (e.g., Gemini).
    - [ ] The prompt should ask the LLM to provide a 3-sentence executive summary for a non-technical business owner.
    - [ ] The LLM's response is saved to a new `ai_summary` text column on the `analyses` table.
    - [ ] **Tests:** A unit test is written that mocks the database call to fetch issues and mocks the LLM API call, verifying that the `analyses` table is updated with the mock summary.
- **Implementation Details:**
    - A new `ai_summary` column must be added to the `analyses` table in the `001_initial_schema.sql` migration.
    - The master worker will need to be updated to track the completion of all analyzer jobs and enqueue this final summary job.
