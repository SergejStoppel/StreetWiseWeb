### **Phase 2: The Modular Analysis Engine**

#### **Issue #2.6: Implement SEO Worker: On-Page Content**

- **Problem:** The content and structure of the HTML itself are a primary factor in SEO ranking.
- **Goal/Benefit:** To provide actionable advice on how to improve the page's content structure for both users and search engines, handled by a dedicated, lightweight worker.
- **Acceptance Requirements:**
    - [ ] A `workers/seo/onPageContent.worker.ts` is created.
    - [ ] The worker analyzes the pre-fetched HTML DOM.
    - [ ] It performs checks for:
        -   Presence and length of the `<title>` tag.
        -   Presence and length of the `meta name="description"` tag.
        -   Proper heading hierarchy (e.g., only one `<h1>`, no skipped heading levels).
    - [ ] It creates records in the `seo_issues` table for each finding.
    - [ ] **Tests:** A unit test is written with mock HTML containing various title/description/heading issues, verifying they are all caught.
- **Implementation Details:**
    - Use a library like `cheerio` to easily parse and traverse the HTML DOM on the server side.
