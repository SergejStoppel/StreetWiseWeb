### **Phase 1: Database Schema & Authentication**

#### **Issue #1.1: Create and Automate Initial Database Schema**

- **Problem:** The database tables and relationships need to be created before any application code can interact with them.
- **Goal/Benefit:** A fully provisioned database that matches our final schema design, created automatically on startup.
- **Acceptance Requirements:**
    - [ ] A new SQL migration file (`001_initial_schema.sql`) is created in `backend-v2/src/db/migrations/`.
    - [ ] The script contains the `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables in our final DBML design.
    - [ ] All columns, types, indexes, and `ON DELETE CASCADE` foreign key relationships are correctly defined.
    - [ ] The `postgres` service in `docker-compose.yml` is configured to automatically run any `*.sql` scripts from a mounted volume on its first run.
    - [ ] After starting the Docker environment, all tables and relations exist in the database.
- **Implementation Details:**
    - Translate the final `proposed_schema.dbml` into valid PostgreSQL DDL.
    - Use the official PostgreSQL Docker image's `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` mechanism to run the setup script. Mount the migrations directory to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` in the `postgres` service definition.
